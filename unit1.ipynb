This allows you to edit this block of text. This block of text is written using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), which is a way to format text using headers, links, italics, and many other options. Hit _shift_ + _enter_ or _shift_ + _return_ on your keyboard to show the formatted text again.

However, any cells that come afterward won't be automatically updated. Try it out below. First run each of the three cells. The first two don't have any output, but you will be able to tell they've run because a number will appear next to them, for example, \"In [5]\".

Then rerun the first and third cells without rerunning the second.\n\nYou should have seen that the third cell still printed \"Intro to Data Analysis is awesome!\"  That's because you didn't rerun the second cell, so even though the `class_name` variable was updated, the `message` variable was not.  Now try rerunning the second cell, and then the third.\n\nYou should have seen the output change to \"*your name* is awesome!\"  Often, after changing a cell, you'll want to rerun all the cells below it.  You can do that quickly by clicking \"Cell > Run All Below\".\n\nOne final thing to remember: if you shut down the kernel after saving your notebook, the cells' output will still show up as you left it at the end of your session when you start the notebook back up. However, the state of the kernel will be reset. If you are actively working on a notebook, remember to re-run your cells to set up your working environment to really pick up where you last left off.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='section2'></a>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.
